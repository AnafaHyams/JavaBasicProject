The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life
If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans
Hasta la vista, baby
I don’t know how much longer I can hold this
I like this car
Come with me if you want to live
I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle
I’ll be back
